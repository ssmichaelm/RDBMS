# RDBMS

Each question has a corresponding .sql file that performs the necessary SQL functions that get the answer. 
For questions 2, 3, 5, and 6, the answers that came from writing and performing the queries are saved in a .csv file.
For questions 1, 4, and 7, however, the answer was 0 (or nothing); thus there are no .csv files for them.
